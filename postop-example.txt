Post-Operative Care Instructions

Rest and Elevation:
Keep your ankle elevated above the level of your #HeartSign heart as much as possible for the first 48-72 hours post-surgery. This helps reduce swelling and pain. Limit your activity. Avoid standing or walking for prolonged periods.

Ice Therapy:
Apply ice packs to the surgical area for 20 minutes every 2 hours while awake for the first 48 hours to reduce swelling and pain. Avoid direct contact of ice with the skin.

Pain Management:
Medications prescribed:  3 high strength Ibuprofen every 4 hours.
Follow the prescribed dosage. Do not exceed the recommended amount.
If pain persists or worsens, contact your surgeon.

Wound Care:
Keep the surgical dressing clean and dry. Do not remove or change it unless instructed by your surgeon. Watch for signs of infection (increased redness, swelling, warmth, or discharge) and report them to your doctor.

Mobility and Support:
Use crutches provided to you. Avoid putting weight on your operated ankle until your doctor advises. 

Physical Therapy:
You may be referred to a physical therapist to start exercises to improve movement and strength. Follow the exercise regimen as prescribed.

Follow-Up Care:
Schedule and attend all follow-up appointments with your surgeon.
Notify your surgeon of any concerns or complications immediately.

Diet and Hydration:
Eat a balanced diet rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals to aid in healing.
Stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water.

Smoking and Alcohol:
Avoid smoking as it can delay healing and increase the risk of complications.
Limit alcohol consumption, as it can interfere with medications and recovery.

Emergency Contact:
In case of an emergency or if you have concerns, contact 1-800-634-5789 or visit the nearest emergency room.
